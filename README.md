# tint3 panel [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jmc-88/tint3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jmc-88/tint3)

This project aims to continue the development of tint2, port it to C++, make it safer against crashes, and have it use XCB instead of Xlib.

## How is this different from tint2?

It shouldn't be much different from tint2 from a user's point of view at this stage. The focus is mostly on having a cleaner, more robust codebase.

## How stable is it?

Pretty stable. I use it daily and I haven't seen issues in a while, but if you happen to find any, please [file a bug](https://github.com/jmc-88/tint3/issues).

## Is it packaged for my Linux distribution?

Most likely, it's not. There's a user-contributed package for ArchLinux in AUR, [tint3-cpp-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tint3-cpp-git).

## How do I build it?

Please refer to [README.source.md](README.source.md).
